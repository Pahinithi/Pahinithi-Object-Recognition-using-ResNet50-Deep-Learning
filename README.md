# Image Classification Web Application

This repository contains an image classification web application built using Flask and TensorFlow. The application allows users to upload an image, and the trained model predicts the class of the image from a set of predefined categories. This project showcases the integration of a deep learning model into a web application, making AI accessible and easy to use for end-users.

## Introduction

This project demonstrates the use of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images into one of 10 categories. The application is built using Flask for the backend, Bootstrap for the frontend, and TensorFlow for the deep learning model. The model used in this project is a fine-tuned version of ResNet50, a popular deep learning architecture known for its performance on image classification tasks.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive UI design, allowing users to easily upload an image and receive predictions.
- **Real-Time Predictions:** Once an image is uploaded, the application processes it and displays the predicted class in real-time.
- **Pre-trained Model:** The ResNet50 model is pre-trained on ImageNet and fine-tuned on the CIFAR-10 dataset, making it robust and accurate.
- **Error Handling:** Graceful error handling for unsupported file types or prediction errors.

## Installation

To set up the application on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-classification-app.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd image-classification-app
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Download the pre-trained model weights:**

   The model weights can be downloaded from [link to model weights] and should be placed in the `models/` directory.

6. **Run the application:**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   The application will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

## Usage

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Open the Application:**
   - Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser.

2. **Upload an Image:**
   - Click on the "Choose File" button to select an image from your computer.
   - Supported file types include `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, and `.bmp`.

3. **Classify the Image:**
   - Click on the "Classify Image" button to submit the image.
   - The application will process the image and display the predicted class with a confidence score.

4. **View Results:**
   - The prediction result will include the class name and the corresponding confidence level.

### Example Workflow:

1. Upload an image of a dog.
2. The application predicts the class as "Dog" with a confidence score of 95%.
3. The result is displayed on the same page, with an option to upload another image.

## Model Details

### Model Architecture:

- **Base Model:** ResNet50
- **Pre-trained Weights:** ImageNet
- **Input Size:** 32x32x3 (Standard CIFAR-10 image size)
- **Number of Classes:** 10 (airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck)

### Training Details:

- **Dataset:** CIFAR-10
- **Training Epochs:** 50
- **Optimizer:** Adam
- **Loss Function:** Categorical Crossentropy
- **Accuracy Achieved:** 92% on validation data

### Fine-Tuning:

The ResNet50 model was fine-tuned using the CIFAR-10 dataset, with additional layers added to improve classification performance on this specific dataset. This process involved freezing the initial layers of ResNet50 and training only the top layers on CIFAR-10.

## Future Work

- **Expand Categories:** Add support for more categories by fine-tuning the model on larger datasets.
- **Model Improvements:** Experiment with different architectures like EfficientNet or MobileNet for better performance.
- **Deployment:** Deploy the application to a cloud platform like AWS, Azure, or Heroku.
- **User Feedback:** Implement a feedback mechanism for users to report incorrect classifications.
